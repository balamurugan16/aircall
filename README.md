| Assessment name       | Front End Assessment |
| Name of the candidate | Balamurugan D        |

### Tech Stack used:
1. React
2. TypeScript
3. Vite
4. Redux Toolkit + RTK Query
5. MUI

### Points to convey to the Judge
1. The API provided for the assessment responded with insufficient data which I had to filter out.
2. From the given boilerplate, I replaced Typescript for JavaScript and Vite for Webpack. This is to improve my developer productivity.

### Noteworthy feature implementations

1. Implemented dark and light theme functionality
2. Used RTK Query library that can handle caching and invalidation for the data that is fetched.
3. Used Typescript as improves type safety and developer productivity
4. Used Vite as the build tool for efficiency
